## What is Convolution Reverb?
Convolution reverb is used in audio signal processing to simulate reverberations from different environments. By using an impulse response from a specific environment, any audio signal can be transformed to sound as if it was recorded there.

## Usage
To use the most optimized version:
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/sukhjot-sekhon/Convolution-Reverb`
2. Compile the file with compiler-level optimizations `gcc -Ofast Reverb.cpp -o Reverb`
3. Run the program with input and impulse response WAVE files `Reverb input.wav impulse.wav output.wav`
  
## Features
* __Reading and writing WAVE files__
* Performing __Convolution Reverb__
  
## Optimizations
My initial version of this tool was very slow, with some optimizations, performance was improved by **742,022%**
* Changed from input side convolution algorithm to a *fast Fourier transform*
* Precomputing results of expensive operations
* Strength reduction in computing the next greatest power of two
* Partially unrolling loops
* Minimizing array references
* Caching values instead of recomputing
* Jamming loops together
* Compiler-level optimizations
